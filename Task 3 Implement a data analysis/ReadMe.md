# Titanic Data Analysis Project

This project involves exploring and visualizing the Titanic dataset using Python, pandas, and matplotlib. The goal is to gain insights from the dataset through various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and visualizations.

## Project Structure

- `titanic_analysis.py`: Main script to load, clean, and visualize the Titanic dataset.
- `README.md`: This readme file.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The dataset contains information about the passengers who were on board the Titanic.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the script:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```sh
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

How to Run the Script
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using the command mentioned above.
Download the Titanic dataset from the provided URL or use the direct URL in the script.
Run the script using the following command:

python titanic_analysis.py

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The script performs the following steps:

Load the dataset: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
Display the first few rows: The first few rows of the dataset are displayed.
Summary statistics: Summary statistics of the dataset are displayed.
Missing values: The number of missing values in each column is displayed.
Data Cleaning: Missing values are handled and data types are converted if necessary.
Data Visualization: Various visualizations are created to gain insights from the data.
Visualizations
The following visualizations are created in the script:

Distribution of numerical features:
Age
Fare
Count of categorical features:
Survived
Pclass
Sex
Correlation heatmap: A heatmap showing the correlation between different features.
Relationship between features and survival rate:
Survival rate by Pclass
Survival rate by Sex
Example Visualizations
Distribution of Age

Distribution of Fare

Count of Survived

Correlation Heatmap

Future Work
Add more visualizations to explore other relationships in the dataset, such as survival rate by age groups or embarkation points.
Implement unit tests to validate the data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
